Management of preference list values
====================================

Management of specific keys and their values can be done using these states.

.. code-block:: yaml

    /Library/Preferences/x.plist:
        plist.managed_keys:
            - key:
                nested_key: 'value'
            - key_two: True

.. note::

    This uses native API by default, and therefore should be safe with files managed by cfprefsd.
    Apple still does not recommend modification of property lists if the owning process is running.
